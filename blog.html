    <p class="blog1">
        Hi my name is Lila and i am 14 years old i was born in ottawa canada, i have one brother and a mom and dad.

        Most of my family lives in Canada but I do have some relatives in Spain too! The cousins I see most often are
        only a 14 minute drive away!

        On my moms side of the family there are 8 grandchildren. I am one of them and I am the only girl. On my dads
        side it's more even the boy to girl thing. There are 5 girls and 3 boys.

        I go to Agincourt Road public school more known as ARPS though! It's a k-8 school that I have been going to
        since I was 4 years old. I am in a class with all of my friends! well that is mostly because we only have 2
        grade 8 classes. I am now doing the mini enrichment program with Kat, Isabel, Georgia, Sally and Ryan.

        I have now learned how to make my own website doing a website course at CU now all that's left is to make it
        pretty. I am a great designer so I thought that this would be more design but turns out it's more coding but it
        was a lot of fun!
